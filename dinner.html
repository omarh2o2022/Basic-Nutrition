    <p>Dinner usually refers to what is in many Western cultures the largest and most formal meal of the day, which is eaten in the evening. Historically, the largest meal used to be eaten around midday, and called dinner.[1] Especially among the elite, it gradually migrated to later in the day over the 16th to 19th centuries.[2] The word has different meanings depending on culture, and may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day.[3] In particular, it is still sometimes used for a meal at noon or in the early afternoon on special occasions, such as a Christmas dinner.[2] In hot climates, the main meal is more likely to be eaten in the evening, after the temperature has fallen.</p>
