         <h1>Most important elements in nutrition</h1>
         <p>Nutrition consists of the reincorporation and transformation of matter and energy of organisms (both heterotrophic and autotrophic) so that they can carry out three fundamental processes: maintenance of internal conditions, development and movement,1 maintaining the homeostatic balance of the organism through molecular and microscopic level.

            <p>Breakfast is often called ‘the most important meal of the day’, and for good reason. As the name suggests, breakfast breaks the overnight fasting period.

            <p class="note-two">In modern society, we often hear the saying, “breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” But in dozens of countries around the world, lunch holds a place of cultural importance. In many studies, researchers have found that lunch may be even more important for school-aged children than any other demographic. Most schools don’t provide breakfast; therefore, lunch is the only meal that students have to give them energy throughout the day.</p>

        <div class="phrase"><p>“This is what people don’t understand: obesity is a symptom of poverty. It’s not a lifestyle choice where people are just eating and not exercising. It’s because kids – and this is the problem with the school lunch right now – are getting sugar, fat and empty calories – lots of calories –but no nutrition.”</p></div>
